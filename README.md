## Current
Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Applied Computer Science. My course was started in Spring 2021.

## Background
I'm From India. My hometown is Vijayawada which comes in the southern part of India. I have completed my undergrad at KL University, Vijayawada, India. My hobbies are cooking, sketching.

## Plans
I am looking forward to be a software developer. Only if interested, I will contribute more than my best. I enjoy trying new things and improving my skills. I may appear to be an introvert at first, but only God knows what type of opposite person I can be when I connect very well with the person.
